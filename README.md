# Fast_convolution_algorithms_for_Real_valued_finite_length_sequences
A comprehensive DFT algorithm where every calculation is natively real-valued dot products. In this paper, we first apply the natively real-valued DFT to linear convolution. We call this method the RV-based convolution. The arithmetic analysis reveals that it efficiently reduces the operation counts. The algorithm is fast regardless of length. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10096394
